# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the code for the "Getting and Cleanding Data" course project.
It contains run_analysis.R, which will download a dataset about [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), cleans it up and will write out a new dataset in CSV format (result-summarized.csv), which contains the summarized data (means of each variable per subject and activity).
